# Fractal Transformations

This repo is a collection of vertex shaders to visualize
what the variations in Apophysis do. Variations are usually
non-linear functions and often hard to visualize.

## Dependencies

This is designed to use [glslViewer](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/glslViewer). Install that first

## Usage

`glslViewer grid.frag <variation>.vert unit_square.ply`
